# Lutemons Game

## ðŸ“– Description
This Android project allows users to create and collect Lutemons, each with unique attributes. Users can train them and control them in battle. The game supports saving/loading Lutemon data and visualizes each type of Lutemon with a unique image.

## ðŸ§© Features

### Lutemon Management
- Users can create different types of Lutemons, each with a unique image.
- Newly created Lutemons are placed in the "Home" area and displayed using a RecyclerView.
- Users can move selected Lutemons to training areas or battle arenas.
- Multiple Lutemons can be trained simultaneously. Only two Lutemons can participate in a battle.

### Training System
- Users can send multiple Lutemons to the training area, where they are displayed with a RecyclerView.
- Lutemons gain experience points when trained using a button.
- Experience increases a Lutemonâ€™s attack power during battle, while the original attack attribute remains unchanged.

### Turn-Based Battle System
- Two Lutemons can be selected to battle, shown in a RecyclerView.
- Battles follow a turn-based system:
  1. One Lutemon attacks while the other defends.
  2. The battle progresses via a **Next Turn** button until one Lutemonâ€™s health reaches zero.
  3. The winner gains an experience point.
  4. The loser is not removed from the game but loses all gained experience.
- Attack power is also affected by random factors to increase unpredictability.

### Lutemon Recovery
- When a Lutemon returns home, its health is fully restored.
- Experience points remain intact unless the Lutemon was defeated in battle, in which case it loses all experience.

### Data Storage & Loading
- All Lutemons are automatically saved to a local file.
- On app launch, saved Lutemons are loaded and displayed on the Home screen.
